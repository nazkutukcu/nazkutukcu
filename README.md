### Hi there, I'm Naz ðŸ‘‹

In my projects i always wanted to improve myself as learning new concepts and also i tried to apply what iâ€™ve learned from my education. With my internshipsâ€™ experience, i found chance to implement my school knowledge to real life. I learned how to become a part of big Project and also part of a team. My biggest goal is to bring a new perspective to my job by discovering new technologies and concepts.
